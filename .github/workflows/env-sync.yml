name: Sync env to GitHub Secrets
# ⚠️ DEPRECATED: Use env-to-secrets.yml instead
# This workflow is disabled to prevent reading .env from the repo
#
# To sync secrets, use the manual env-to-secrets workflow which:
# 1. Only runs manually (workflow_dispatch)
# 2. Uses the bin/env-to-secrets script properly
