## 🚀 Key Recommendation

### **REDEPLOY - High Confidence (8/10)**

**Why:**
1. ✅ Solid technical foundation (6 months production-tested)
2. ✅ Clear market gap with no direct competitor
3. ✅ Low investment ($15K-25K) vs. high potential ($1M+ ARR in 3 years)
4. ✅ First-mover advantage in niche market
5. ✅ Growing demand for API-first developer tools

**Next Steps:**
1. **Week 1:** Fix critical security issues (remove hardcoded secrets, add auth)
2. **Weeks 2-3:** Add testing and documentation
3. **Weeks 4-6:** Build landing page and developer portal
4. **Weeks 7-8:** Launch beta with 50-100 users

**Investment Required:**
- **Immediate:** $15K-25K (get to production-ready)
- **Seed Round:** $150K-250K (full execution)
- **Timeline:** 6-8 weeks to beta launch

**Expected Returns:**
- **Month 6:** $3,000 MRR, 50 paid customers
- **Month 12:** $15,000 MRR, 200 paid customers
- **Month 18:** Break-even at $20,000 MRR
